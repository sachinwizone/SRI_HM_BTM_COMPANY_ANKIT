Create a feature comparison table for my software showing three pricing plans: Basic, Advanced, and Premium.

- The table should include at least 6-8 key features (can be placeholders if specific features are not listed) and indicate which features are available in each plan.
- Add the following pricing under each plan:
    - Basic: ₹1,78,500
    - Advanced: ₹3,16,500
    - Premium: ₹3,88,500

- Present the table in a professional, modern style suitable for client presentations.
